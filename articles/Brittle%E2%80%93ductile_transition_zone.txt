"The strongest part of the Earth's crust

Variation of strength with depth in continental crust and changes in dominant deformation mechanisms and fault rocks in a conceptual vertical fault zone.

The brittle-ductile transition zone is the strongest part of the Earth's crust. For quartz and feldspar rich rocks in continental crust this occurs at an approximate depth of 13–18 km (roughly equivalent to temperatures in the range 250–400 °C). At this depth rock becomes less likely to fracture,
