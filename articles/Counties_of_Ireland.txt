Administrative division of Ireland, historically 32 in number

The 32 traditional counties of Ireland

The counties of Ireland (Irish: contaetha na h√âireann; Ulster-Scots: coonties o Airlann) are sub-national divisions that have been, and in some cases continue to be, used to geographically demarcate areas of local government. These land divisions were formed following the Norman invasion of Ireland in imitation of the counties then in use as units of local government in the Kingdom of England.
