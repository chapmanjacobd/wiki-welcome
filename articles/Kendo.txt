Kendo (剣道, kendō, lit. 'sword way', 'sword path' or 'way of the sword') is a traditional Japanese martial art, which descended from swordsmanship (kenjutsu) and uses bamboo swords (shinai) and protective armour (bōgu). Today, it is widely practiced within Japan and many other nations across the world
