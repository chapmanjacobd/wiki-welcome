La Danse macabre

Danse macabre, Op. 40, is a tone poem for orchestra, written in 1874 by the French composer Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns. It is in the key of G minor. It started out in 1872 as an art song for voice and piano with a French text by the poet Henri Cazalis, which is based on an old French superstition.
