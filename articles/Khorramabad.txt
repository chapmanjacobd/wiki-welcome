Etymology

"KhorMoah" is the way local call it. "KhorMoa" in Lori and Laki, local languages, means the place that you can see the sunset.

"KhorMoah" has been translated as "Khorram Abad" in Farsi which means the green and beautiful place.

Modern Persian -âbâd, meaning "settlement" or "abode", derives from Middle Persian āpāt ("populous"). However, according to linguist Sasha Lubotsky, the Persian term ābād might derive from Proto-Iranian *āpāta ("protected"), rooting from Proto-Indo-European *peh₂- ("to protect"). Thus, it can mean "protected settlement".

History

Pre-Islamic era

Simash

During the late third millennium B.C. and early second millennium B.C., when Simashki sovereigns was ruling on Elam, for the first time a fort was built on the peak of a natural cliff to protect the city against its enemies. Sixty hundred years later, Ellipi kings built a new fort on the ruins of the old one. Simash was the name of the place. It was the capital of Simashki dynasty.

Shapurkhast

In the texts of historians Shapurkhast has been considered one of the most important and developed cities of the region during this period. Falak-ol-Aflak castle ( Dež-e Shāpūr-Khwāst) was built by Shapur I the Sasanid.

ShapurKhast name, in Kufic, on Sang Nebeshteh monument

Islamic era

Probably in the late seventh century CE, Shapurkhast was destroyed and the people of Shapurkhast moved to the western part of Falak-ol-Aflak Castle, which offered plenty of water as well as safety.

Hamdallah Mustawfi writes: Khorramabad was a beautiful city, now it is destroyed.

Hazaraspids

The founder of the Hazaraspid dynasty was Abu Tahir ibn Muhammad, a descendant of the Shabankara chieftain Fadluya. Fadluya was initially a commander of the Salghurids of Fars and was appointed governor of Kuhgiluya but eventually gained independence in Luristan and extended his realm as far as Isfahan. He assumed the prestigious title of atabeg.

Safavid dynasty

During the reign of the Safavid dynasty, Khorramabad was the administrative center of Luristan Province. In the wake of the demise of the Safavids, after the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople (1724) with Imperial Russia, the Ottomans conquered Khorramabad on 6 September 1725.

Qajar dynasty

In this period, the city of Khorramabad was limited to environs of Falak-ol-Aflak Castle. This period was the beginning of a migration of people from small villages into Khorramabad. The increase in population led to the expansion of the city and the creation of new districts.

Pahlavi dynasty

Khorramabad Municipality was formed in 1913 and the first city council, consisting of seven members, was formed in 1916.

ShapurKhast Castle

ShapurKhast Castle

ShapurKhast Castle, Dež-e Shāpūr-Khwāst, Falak-ol-Aflak Castle, known in ancient times as Dezbaz as well as Shapur-Khast, is one of the most impressive castles in Iran. It is situated on the top of a large hill with the same name within the city of Khorramabad, the regional capital of Lorestan province. The Khorramabad River runs past the eastern and south-western side of the ShapurKhast hill providing the fortress with an element of natural protection. Today, the western and northern sides of the hill are bordered by the residential districts of Khorramabad.
This gigantic structure was built during the Sassanid era (226–651). It has been known by a number of names since it was built over 1800 years ago. Recorded names have referred to it as Shapur-Khast fortress, Dezbaz, Khorramabad castle, and ultimately the Falak ol-Aflak Castle.
The foundations of the actual castle measure approximately 300 meters by 400 meters. The height of the entire structure, including the hill, reaches up to 40 meters above the surrounding area. This space is divided into four large halls, and their associated rooms and corridors. The rooms all surround two courtyards with the following measurements: the first courtyard measures 31×22.50 meters and the second 29x21 meters. . When originally built the castle used to have 12 towers, but only 8 remain standing today. The building's entrance is situated towards the north, within the body of the north-western tower.

From the initial day of erection the castle served a whole variety of purposes including political, military, governmental and social. Now, Dec. 2019, archaeology and anthropology museums are located inside the castle. Bronzes of Lorestan are among the interesting handmade objects inside the archaeology museum. This scarce monument has been inscribed on the National Heritage List under the registration number of 883.

The construction was once used for rationing and distributing potable and agricultural water among local population and farmers. Its surrounding cylindrical stone wall has a height of 10 meters and a diameter of 18 meters.
There are a few different-sized outlets in the wall for controlling the flow of water into a canal on the west of the structure. While originally there were 7 of such outlets, however, today only one is functional. This outlet measures 160 x 90 centimeters and opens and closes like a drawer. There is traces of another outlet which the water was flowing from it and was reaching to a stream called Nahre Naseri. The flowing water after a path of approximately 12 kilometers, would eventually made its way to a valley called Baba Abbas. The main interesting thing is the way that they have conducted the water to the stream. Gerdab Sangi has been inscribed on the National Heritage List in 1976.

The current height of minaret is 29.45 meters. Since one of the windows of the minaret is located on top of it, undoubtedly its height was higher. A cylindrical column was built inside the minaret and through 99 spiral staircases around the column one can reach to the top of the minaret. The entrance is opened to the west and its characteristics are as follows: length: 80 cm, height: 220 cm. The minaret has six windows of different sizes.
