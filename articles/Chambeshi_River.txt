The Chambeshi River is the easternmost stream in red.

The Chambeshi (or Chambezi) River of northeastern Zambia is the most remote headstream of the Congo River (in length) and therefore its source is in the Congo River. (However, by volume of water, the Lualaba River is the greater "source" of the Congo.) 

The Chambeshi rises as a stream in the mountains of northeast Zambia near Lake Tanganyika at an elevation of 1,760 metres (5,770 ft) above sea level. It flows for 480 km into the Bangweulu S
