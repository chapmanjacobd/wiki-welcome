Transform fault (the red lines)

A transform fault or transform boundary is a fault along a plate boundary where the motion is predominantly horizontal. It ends abruptly where it connects to another plate boundary, either another transform, a spreading ridge, or a subduction zone.

Most such faults are found in oceanic crust, where they accommodate the la
