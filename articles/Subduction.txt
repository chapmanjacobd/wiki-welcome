"A geological process at convergent tectonic plate boundaries where one plate moves under the other

Diagram of the geological process of subduction

Subduction is a geological process that takes place at convergent boundaries of tectonic plates where one plate moves under another and is forced to sink due to high gravitational potential energy into the mantle. Regions where this process occurs are known as subduction zones. Rates of subduction are typically measured in centimeters per year, wit
