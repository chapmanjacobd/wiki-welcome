Giovanni Pisano began the facade of Siena Cathedral and provided its sculptures. (The sculptures are replicas.)

Giovanni Pisano (c. 1250 â€“ c. 1315) was an Italian sculptor, painter and architect, who worked in the cities of Pisa, Siena and Pistoia. He is best known for his sculpture which shows the influence of both the French Gothic and the Ancient Roman art. Henry Moore, referring to his statues for the facade of Siena Cathedral, called him "the first modern sculptor".
