Sr√≤n a Chorra Bhuilg, a typical promontory, in the Scottish Highlands.

A promontory is a raised mass of land that projects into a lowland or a body of water (in which case it is a peninsula).

Most promontories either are formed from a hard ridge of rock that has resisted the erosive forces that have removed the softer rock to the sides of it, or are the high ground that remains between two river valleys where they form a confluence.
