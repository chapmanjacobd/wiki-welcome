Agricultural tool

Pitching hay

A pitchfork is an agricultural tool with a long handle and two or three tines used to lift and pitch or throw loose material, such as hay, straw or leaves.

The term is also applied colloquially, but inaccurately, to the garden fork. While similar in appearance, the garden fork is shorter and stockier than the pitchfork, with three or four thicker tines intended for turning or loosening the soil of gardens.
