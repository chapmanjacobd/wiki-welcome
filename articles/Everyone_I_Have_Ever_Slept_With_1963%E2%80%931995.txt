Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 by Tracey Emin (1995). An exterior view of the work.

Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 (1995), also known as The Tent, was an artwork created by Tracey Emin. The work was a tent with the appliquéd names of, literally, everyone she had ever slept with, but not necessarily in the sexual sense. It achieved iconic status, was owned by Charles Saatchi, and was destroyed in the 2004 Momart London warehouse fire. She has refused to re-create it.
