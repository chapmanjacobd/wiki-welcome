Suede boot

Suede (pronounced /sweɪd/ (SWAYD)) is a type of leather with a napped finish, commonly used for jackets, shoes, shirts, purses, furniture, and other items. The term comes from the French gants de Suède, which literally means "gloves from Sweden".

Suede is made from the underside of the animal skin, which is softer and more pliable than, though not as durable as, the outer skin layer.
