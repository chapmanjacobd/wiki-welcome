The asthenosphere shown at a subduction boundary

The asthenosphere (Ancient Greek: ἀσθενός  meaning "without strength", and thus "weak", and σφαίρα  meaning "sphere") is the highly viscous, mechanically weak and ductile region of the upper mantle of the Earth. It lies below the lithosphere, at depths between approximately 80 and 200 km (50 and 120 miles) below the surface. The lithosphere–asthenosph
