The Bangui magnetic anomaly in central Africa and the Kursk magnetic anomaly in eastern Europe (both in red)

In geophysics, a magnetic anomaly is a local variation in the Earth's magnetic field resulting from variations in the chemistry or magnetism of the rocks. Mapping of variation over an area is valuable in detecting structures obscured by overlying material. The magnetic variation in successive bands of ocean f
