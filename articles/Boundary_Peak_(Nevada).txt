Geography

Boundary Peak is the northernmost peak of 13,000 feet or greater elevation within the White Mountains. The summit is located in Esmeralda County of southwestern Nevada, and is within the Boundary Peak Wilderness of the Inyo National Forest. It is less than half a mile (1 km) from the California state line, which is how it derived its name.

While it is the highest point in Nevada, the considerably taller Montgomery Peak (13,441 feet (4,097 m)) is less than a mile away, across the state line in California. By most definitions Boundary Peak, which has a prominence of only 253 feet, is considered to be a sub-peak of Montgomery Peak.

Boundary Peak is only 82 feet (25 m) taller than Wheeler Peak, which is located in Great Basin National Park, White Pine County in eastern Nevada. By most definitions, Wheeler Peak is the tallest independent mountain within Nevada.

Climbing

This peak is most often climbed from the Nevada side. From there, a climber may scramble the ridge connecting to Montgomery Peak. It is recommended that the U.S. Forest Service (Inyo National Forest) be contacted so they can provide climbing information.
