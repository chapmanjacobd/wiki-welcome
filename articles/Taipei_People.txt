"Taipei People (simplified Chinese: 台北人; traditional Chinese: 臺北人 or 台北人; pinyin: Táiběi rén) is a collection of 14 short stories written by Pai Hsien-yung in the 1960s, published in 1971. The length and art of each story is different, but all these short stories are about people who came from Mainland China to Taiwan in the 1950s, and about their life in Taipei.
