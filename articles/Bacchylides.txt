"Ancient Greek lyric poet

A Musician by Albert Joseph Moore (1841–1893)

Bacchylides (/bəˈkɪlɪˌdiːz/; Greek: Βακχυλίδης, Bakkhylídēs; c. 518 – c. 451 BC) was a Greek lyric poet. Later Greeks included him in the canonical list of nine lyric poets which included his uncle Simonides. The elegance and polished style of his lyrics have been noted in Bacchylidean scholarship since at least Longinus. Some scholars, however, have characterized these qualities as superficial charm.
