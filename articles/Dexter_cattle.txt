A red chondrodysplastic-dwarf Dexter cow

Dexter cattle are a breed of cattle originating in Ireland. The smallest of the European cattle breeds, they are about half the size of a traditional Hereford and about one-third the size of a Holstein Friesian milking cow. A rare breed until recently, they are now considered a recovering breed by the Livestock Conservancy.
