Phyllite is a type of foliated metamorphic rock created from slate that is further metamorphosed so that very fine grained white mica achieves a preferred orientation. It is primarily composed of quartz, sericite mica, and chlorite.

Phyllite has fine-grained mica flakes in a preferred orientation, whereas slate has extremely fine mica flakes that achieve a preferred orientation, and schist has large mica
