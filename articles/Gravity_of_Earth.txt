"Acceleration that the Earth imparts to objects on or near its surface

Earth's gravity measured by NASA GRACE mission, showing deviations from the theoretical gravity of an idealized smooth Earth, the so-called Earth ellipsoid. Red shows the areas where gravity is stronger than the smooth, standard value, and blue reveals areas where gravity is weaker. (Animated version.)

The gravity of Earth, denoted by g, is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravi
