Gisele Caroline Bündchen (Brazilian Portuguese: , German: , born 20 July 1980) is a Brazilian model, environmental activist, author, actress, and businesswoman.

Since 2001, Bündchen has been one of the highest-paid models in the world. In 2007, she was the 16th richest woman in the entertainment industry, and earned the top spot on Forbes top-earning models list in 2012. In 2014, Bündchen was listed as the 89th Most Powerful Woman in the World by Forbes.

Vogue has credited Bündchen with ending the heroin chic era of modeling in 1999; instead ushering in a sexy, healthy look with curves and a golden tan. Bündchen was a Victoria's Secret Angel from 2000 until mid-2007 and had signed Victoria's Secret's biggest contract to date. She is credited with pioneering and popularizing the "horse walk", a stomping movement created by a model lifting her knees high and kicking her feet to step. In 2007, Claudia Schiffer called Bündchen the only remaining supermodel. Bündchen has appeared on more than 1,200 magazine covers.

Bündchen was nominated for Choice Movie Female Breakout Star and for Choice Movie Villain at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards for her supporting role in Taxi (2004).

In 2016, she appeared in the Emmy award-winning documentary series Years of Living Dangerously, in the episode Fueling the Fire, sharing the episode with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Family and early life

Bündchen is a Brazilian of German descent. Born to Vânia (née Nonnenmacher), a bank clerk pensioner, and Valdir Bündchen, a sociologist and writer, in Horizontina, Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil, she grew up with five sisters, Raquel, Graziela, Gabriela, Rafaela and her fraternal twin, Patrícia. Bündchen learned German in school, but said she forgot the language after being out of touch with it. In addition to Portuguese and English, Bündchen speaks Spanish and some French.

Bündchen aspired to be a volleyball player but joined a modeling course with her sisters Patrícia and Gabriela at their mother's insistence in 1993, in hopes to correct her bad posture. The following year, she was discovered by Elite Model Management at a shopping mall in São Paulo. Bündchen was selected for a national contest, Elite Model Look (then known as Look of the Year), in which she placed second. In early 1995, at age 14, Bündchen moved to São Paulo to launch her modeling career. She had her first break in 1996, at New York Fashion Week.

Career

1997–2000: Career beginnings

Bündchen traveled to London in 1997, where she auditioned for 43 shows, but took part in only two international shows. Alexander McQueen chose her for his Spring 1998 ready-to-wear show, "Rain!", because of her ability to walk in towering heels on a slippery runway. In 1998, Bündchen posed for Missoni, Chloé, Dolce & Gabbana, Valentino, Gianfranco Ferré, Ralph Lauren, and Versace campaigns. She appeared on the cover of Vogue Paris, her first cover of British Vogue, and i-D, which featured her on its cover, profiling "A Girl Called Gisele". In 1999, Bündchen left Elite Model Management to switch to IMG Models, dissatisfied with Elite's work environment.

In addition to her first American Vogue cover in July 1999, dubbed "the return of the sexy model", she appeared on her first group Vogue cover with fellow supermodels Kate Moss, Amber Valletta, Christy Turlington, Iman, Lauren Hutton, Naomi Campbell, Stephanie Seymour, Claudia Schiffer, Lisa Taylor, Paulina Porizkova, Carolyn Murphy, and Patti Hansen. In December of that year, she once again appeared on a solo American Vogue cover. She won the VH1/Vogue Model of the Year for 1999. Noting Bündchen was shooting five major campaigns at the age of 18, New York magazine editor Sally Singer said Bündchen was so successful in the industry that she deemed her an "über- (not super-) model". She became the fourth model to appear on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine when she was named "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World" in 2000. The same year, Vogue's online encyclopedia of models called Bündchen the world's hottest model and said she opened a new category: the Brazilian bombshell.

2000–2009: Modeling breakthrough, international success, and acting debut

In 2000, Bündchen appeared on 37 international Vogue covers, including three in the American edition. In January 2000, Bündchen was simultaneously featured on the covers of the U.S. and British editions of Vogue. The June issue co-starred George Clooney. For spring 2000 fashion week, she opened shows for Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Dior, and Valentino in New York, Milan and Paris. From 1998–2003, Bündchen was in every Dolce & Gabbana fashion campaign, totaling 11 consecutive campaigns with the brand; she returned as the face of the brand's fragrance "The One", in campaigns from 2006 to 2009. Bündchen retired from the runway upon signing a lucrative contract with Victoria's Secret. In 2000, Bündchen wore Victoria's Secret's Fantasy bra, the Red Hot Fantasy Bra, worth $15 million and listed in Guinness World Records as the most expensive lingerie ever created. Bündchen also modeled the "Sexy Splendor Fantasy Bra" in 2005, which was the second-most expensive bra ever made, valued at $12.5 million. In 2004, she appeared on another group American Vogue cover, with Daria Werbowy, Natalia Vodianova, Isabeli Fontana, Karolina Kurkova, Liya Kebede, Hana Soukupova, Gemma Ward, and Karen Elson. Bündchen has appeared on the covers of W, Allure, GQ, Forbes, Marie Claire, TIME, Vanity Fair, Esquire, and in the Pirelli Calendar.

In acting roles, Bündchen co-starred with Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon in the 2004 remake of Taxi and in 2006, Bündchen played Serena in The Devil Wears Prada. Bündchen was chosen by Time magazine in 2007, as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. In September 2007, Bündchen was photographed by Mario Testino for the cover of Vanity Fair's style issue. In 2008, she appeared on the cover of Vogue with NBA player LeBron James (who, at the time, was one of only 3 men to ever appear on the cover, along with Clooney). Some criticized the cover for giving the appearance of fictional movie monster King Kong holding actress Fay Wray, therefore perceived to be perpetuating racial stereotypes.

Forbes listed her 53rd on their 2007 list of the most powerful celebrities. Ipanema Gisele Bündchen made an estimated £152 million (about $197 million) with more than 250 million pairs sold in 2010. In May 2007, Bündchen had ended her contract with Victoria's Secret; she described this decision as closing that chapter of her career.

After experiencing a period of depression, Bündchen decided to end her relationship with DiCaprio after she felt their lifestyles no longer complemented, saying in her memoir Lessons, " I was becoming more and more aware of things that I'd chosen not to look at. Was I alone in wanting to do some serious soul-searching while he stayed the same? In the end, unfortunately, the answer was yes."

In late 2006, Bündchen began dating NFL quarterback Tom Brady, after a mutual friend introduced them on a blind date. The couple married on 26 February 2009 in a small ceremony at St. Monica Catholic Church in Santa Monica, California. In April 2009, the couple had a second marriage ceremony, in Costa Rica.
