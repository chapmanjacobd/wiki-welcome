"Field of research that compares the developmental processes of different organisms to infer the ancestral relationships

Homologous hox genes in such different animals as insects and vertebrates control embryonic development and hence the form of adult bodies. These genes have been highly conserved through hundreds of millions of years of evolution.

Evolutionary developmental biology (informally, evo-devo) is a field of biological research that compares the developmental processes of different
