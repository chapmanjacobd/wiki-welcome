"Form of concrete used in construction

Comparison of non-prestressed beam (top) and prestressed concrete beam (bottom) under load:

1. Non-prestressed beam without load

2. Non-prestressed beam with load

3. Before concrete solidifies, tendons embedded in concrete are tensioned

4. After concrete solidifies, tendons apply compressive stress to concrete

5. Prestressed beam without load

6. Prestressed beam with load

Prestressed concrete is a form of concrete used in construction. It is substan
