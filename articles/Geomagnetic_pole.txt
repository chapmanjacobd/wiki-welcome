"The poles of a dipole approximation to the Earth's field

For broader coverage of this topic, see Earth's magnetic field.

Illustration of the difference between geomagnetic poles (Nm and Sm) and geographical poles (Ng and Sg)

The geomagnetic poles are antipodal points where the axis of a best-fitting dipole intersects the surface of Earth. This theoretical dipole is equivalent to a powerful bar magnet at the center of Earth, and comes closer than any other model to describing the magnetic fie
