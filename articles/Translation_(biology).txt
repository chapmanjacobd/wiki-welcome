Overview of the translation of eukaryotic messenger RNA

Diagram showing the translation of mRNA and the synthesis of proteins by a ribosome

Initiation and elongation stages of translation as seen through zooming in on the nitrogenous bases in RNA, the ribosome, the tRNA, and amino acids, with short explanations.

The three phases of translation initiation polymerase binds to the DNA strand and moves along until the small ribosomal subunit binds to the DN
