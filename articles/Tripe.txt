Tripe is a type of edible lining from the stomachs of various farm animals. Most tripe is from cattle and sheep.

World Tripe Day is celebrated on 24 October, according to the Tripe Marketing Board, because in 1662 Samuel Pepys wrote on that day "So home and dined there with my wife upon a most excellent dish of tripes of my own directing."
