Structure of the orthosilicate anion SiO4−

4

In chemistry, a silicate is any member of a family of anions consisting of silicon and oxygen, usually with the general formula [SiO(4−2x)−

4−x]

n, where 0 ≤ x < 2. The family includes orthosilicate SiO4−

4 (x = 0), metasilicate SiO2−

3 (x = 1), and pyrosilicate Si

2O6−

7 (x = 0.5, n = 2). The name is also used for any salt of such anions, such as sodium metasilicate; or any ester containing the corresponding chemical group, su
