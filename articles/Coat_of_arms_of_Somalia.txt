"Coat of arms of Somalia

Armiger Federal Republic of Somalia

Adopted 10 October 1956

The coat of arms of Somalia was adopted on October 10, 1956 and was created by the Italian Giuseppe Ricci. The leopards which support the shield and the white star were also found on the coat of arms used in Italian Somaliland. Formerly, the arms of Somalia from June 8, 1919 featured a shield divided horizontally by a wavy white line (Smith, 1980). The top half of the shield was blue, with a leopard in natural color surmounted by a white five-pointed star. Leopards are a common motif in Somali culture.
