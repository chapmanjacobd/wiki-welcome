"Inner layer of cortex in vascular plant roots


The Endodermis is the central, innermost layer of cortex in land plants. It is a cylinder of compact living cells, the radial walls of which are impregnated with hydrophobic substances (Casparian strip) to restrict apoplastic flow of water to the inside. The endodermis is the boundary between the cortex and the stele.

In many seedless vascular plants, the endodermis is a distinctly visible l
