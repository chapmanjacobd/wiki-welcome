"A set of biological processes by which an eukaryotic RNA primary transcript is modified following transcription to produce a mature, functional RNA molecule

Post-transcriptional modification or co-transcriptional modification is a set of biological processes common to most eukaryotic cells by which an RNA primary transcript is chemically altered following transcription from a gene to produce a mature, functional RNA molecule that can then leave the nucleus and perform any of a variety of diffe
