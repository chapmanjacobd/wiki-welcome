Structure of the Earth. The mesosphere is labeled as Stiffer mantle in this diagram.

The lower mantle, historically mesosphere, represents approximately 56% of the Earth's total volume, and is the region from 660 to 2900 km below the Earth's surface; between the transition zone and the outer core. The Preliminary reference Earth model (PREM) separates the lower mantle into three sections, the uppermost (660–770 km), mid-lower mantle (770–2700 km), and the D layer (2700–2900 km). Pressure
