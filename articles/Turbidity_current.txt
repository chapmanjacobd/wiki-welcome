"An underwater current of usually rapidly moving, sediment-laden water moving down a slope

Turbidites are deposited in the deep ocean troughs below the continental shelf, or similar structures in deep lakes, by underwater turbidity currents (or "underwater avalanches") which slide down the steep slopes of the continental shelf edge, as illustrated in the diagram. When the material comes to rest in the ocean trough, it is the sand and other coarse material which settles first followed by mud and
