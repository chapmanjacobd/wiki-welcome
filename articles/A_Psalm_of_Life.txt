"Poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

"Footprints on the sands of time"

A Psalm of Life

Tell me not, in mournful numbers,

 Life is but an empty dream!â€”

For the soul is dead that slumbers,

 And things are not what they seem.

Life is real! Life is earnest!

 And the grave is not its goal;

Dust thou art, to dust returnest,

 Was not spoken of the soul.

Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,

 Is our destined end or way;

But to act, that each to-morrow

 Find us farther than to-day.

Art is long,
