A bisque doll of Momotarō

Momotarō (桃太郎, "Peach Boy") is a popular hero of Japanese folklore. His name translates as Peach Tarō, a common Japanese masculine name, and is often translated as Peach Boy. Momotarō is the title of various books, films and other works that portray the tale of this hero.

There is now a popular notion that Momotarō is a local hero of Okayama Prefecture, but this claim was invented in the modern era, and not accepted as consensus in scholarly circles.
