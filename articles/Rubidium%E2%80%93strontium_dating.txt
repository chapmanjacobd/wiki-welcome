"Radiometric dating technique for rocks and minerals based on the quantities of specific isotopes of rubidium (⁸⁷Rb) and strontium (⁸⁷Sr, ⁸⁶Sr)

The rubidium-strontium dating method is a radiometric dating technique used by scientists to determine the age of rocks and minerals from the quantities they contain of specific isotopes of rubidium (87Rb) and strontium (87Sr, 86Sr).

Development of this process was aided by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, who later went on t
