Type Composite material

Mechanical properties

Tensile strength (Ïƒt) Stronger than concrete

Concrete with rebar

Reinforced concrete (RC) (also called reinforced cement concrete or RCC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength
