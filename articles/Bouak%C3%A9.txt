Name

For the name of the city Bouaké, there are two possible origins:

The corruption of the chief name Kwa Gbéké that made the foundations of the city of Bouaké.

The name Bouaké coming from two Baoulé words: "Boua" which means sheep and "Ké" which means dry. Thus meaning the place in which sheeps are dried as they would have seen Jola drying sheep skins when they arrived in Bouaké.

Bouaké was established as a French military post in 1899 and has been an administrative center since 1914.

French and United Nations peacekeepers currently reside in the city as part of an enforced ceasefire between the rebel-held north and the government-held south. After the attempt to overthrow the president Laurent Gbagbo had failed, the rebel forces FN (forces nouvelles) led by Guillaume Soro made Bouaké their center of control. Subsequently, Bouaké University, opened in 1996, was closed down in September 2002. Financed by Unesco, the university reopened in April, 2005.

On 4 November 2004, governmental forces used Sukhoi-25s to raid the city as an opening movement towards "territorial liberation", according to Captain Jean-Noël Abbey of the Côte d'Ivoire army. Korhogo, 225 kilometres (140 miles) north of Bouaké, was also targeted.

Tobacco products, building materials, and textiles are produced, and cotton sisal and rice are processed. Gold, mercury, and manganese are found nearby. The overall economy was shaken during the near decade long rebel rule that started in 2002. Many companies either shut down or relocated to Abidjan, Ivory Coast's coastal economic hub. These events resulted in the 60% reduction in formal employment. For example, the city's biggest textile mill, the Gonfreville Establishment, saw an employment decrease of 1200 workers, an 80% reduction. Economic recovery was slow until the early 2010s. After the State took back control of Bouake after the 2010-2011 election, the economy moved into a state of reconstruction. Roads were repaved after years of neglect, which allowed the transportation of goods to become an easier task. Cash crops such as cotton and cashews started to be transported in higher quantities to be processed in Bouake. Singapore-based Olam opened a cashew processing plant in Bouake in 2012, which accounts for nearly 2400 jobs. The agribusiness as a whole is beginning to turn to its original state before the rebel conflict. Additionally, banks have opened new branches and supermarkets have returned to normal operation. The government is stimulating this regrowth through policies, such as price floors, and projects to increase trade, including the construction of a highway to connect Bouake to the nation's capital, Yamoussoukro.

Transports

The city has the Bouaké Airport located north-west of the city with a 3,300 metres (10,800 ft) runway.

Located on the line of the railway which connects Abidjan to Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, the city has the Railway Station Bouaké operated by Sitarail.

The roads that connect Bouaké are the A3 and the A8 going clockwise from the north the A3 connects Katiola and with Korhogo on the A12 eastwards with further destinations in Burkina Faso and Mali. Eastwards the A10 starts in Bouaké and connects to Ghana and to Bondoukou via the A1 northwards and Abengourou southwards. The A8 connects to Abengourou northwards on the A1 and Abidjan southwards. A3 Southbound connects to the political capital Yamoussoukro and the economic capital Abidjan. A8 westbound goes to Beoumi and Lake Kossou continuing to Man and Danané with further destinations in Liberia and Guinea.
