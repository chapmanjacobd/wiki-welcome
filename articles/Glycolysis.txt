 Glycolysis

The metabolic pathway of glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate by via a series of intermediate metabolites. Each chemical modification is performed by a different enzyme. Steps 1 and 3 consume ATP and steps 7 and 10 produce ATP. Since steps 6â€“10 occur twice per glucose molecule, this leads to a net production of ATP.
