Bust of Maecenas at Coole Park, Co. Galway, Ireland

Gaius Cilnius Maecenas (/maɪˈsiːnəs/; circa 70 BC – 8 BC) was a friend and political advisor to Octavian, who later reigned as Augustus. He was also an important patron for the new generation of Augustan poets, including both Horace and Virgil. During the reign of Augustus, Maecenas served as a quasi-culture minister to the Emperor but in spite of his wealth and power he chose not to enter the Senate, remaining of equestrian rank.
