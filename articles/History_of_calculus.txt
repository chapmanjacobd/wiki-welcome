"Calculus, known in its early history as infinitesimal calculus, is a mathematical discipline focused on limits, continuity, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. 
Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed the theory of indefinitesimal calculus in the later 17th century. 
By the end of the 17th century, each scholar claimed that the other had stolen his work, and the Leibniz-Newton calculus controversy continued until the death of Leibniz in 1716.
