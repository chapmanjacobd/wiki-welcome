Taxis to Hell – and Back – Into the Jaws of Death, by Robert F. Sargent, CPhoM, USCG.

Original caption: "American invaders spring from the ramp of a Coast Guard-manned landing barge to wade those last perilous yards to the beach of Normandy. Enemy fire will cut some of them down. Their 'taxi' will pull itself off the sands and dash back to a Coast Guard manned transport for more passengers."
