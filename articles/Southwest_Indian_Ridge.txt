"A mid-ocean ridge on the bed of the south-west Indian Ocean and south-east Atlantic Ocean

Separating the African (or Nubian-Somali plates) and Antarctic plates, the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) stretches 7,700 km (4,800 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean. With an average spreading rate of 14–15 millimetres per year (0.55–0.59 in/year), the SWIR is one of the slowest-spreading mid-ocean ridges on Earth. Characterised by numerous large transform offsets, most of the SWIR is hig
