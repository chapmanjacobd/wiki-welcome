"Parmelian Prints of the High Sierras is a portfolio of 18 silver gelatin photographic prints made by Ansel Adams in 1927. It was the first publication of a portfolio of his prints, produced not long after he decided to become a professional photographer, and has since been called "a landmark work in twentieth-century photography."

As a member of the Sierra Club in the 1920s, Adams joined the Club's annual month-long High Trips in the Sierra in addition to making several trips on his own. Durin
