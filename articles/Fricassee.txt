Chicken fricassée

Fricassee or fricassée /ˈfrɪkəsiː/ is a method of cooking meat in which it is cut up and braised, and served with its sauce (usually a white sauce but some Spanish variations are made with a base).

Fricassee of chicken is commonly found, both in modern recipes and antique ones, but virtually all kinds of meat, poultry, seafood, and even vegetables alone, can be found in fricassee dishes.
