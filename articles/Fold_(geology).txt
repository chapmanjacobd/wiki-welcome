Folds of alternate layers of limestone with chert layers due to the alpine fold tectonics, these sediments were once deposited in a deeper sea basin as tabular formations. Crete; Greece

In structural geology, a fold occurs when one or a stack of originally flat and planar surfaces, such as sedimentary strata, are bent or curved as a result of permanent deformation. Synsedimentary folds are those due to slumping of sedimentary material before it is lithified. Folds in rocks vary in size from mic
