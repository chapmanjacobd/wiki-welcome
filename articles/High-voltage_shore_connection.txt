"A high-voltage shore connection (HVSC) is connection used to connect ships to the main grid, shutting engine of the ship and reducing carbon emissions. 

The ship can use electric power for its consumption of energy. They are mostly used in the cruise ships which dock for longer time and hence save energy.
