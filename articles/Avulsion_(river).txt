"The rapid abandonment of a river channel and formation of a new channel

Plumes of sediment enter the ocean from several mouths of the Mississippi River bird's-foot delta. This sediment is responsible for building the delta and allowing it to advance into the sea. As it extends further offshore, the channel slope will decrease and its bed will aggrade, promoting an avulsion.

In sedimentary geology and fluvial geomorphology, avulsion is the rapid abandonment of a river channel and the formation
