"Medieval era Sanskrit text with animal fables

Nepalese manuscript of the Hitopadesha, c.1800

Maxim on learning

Learning to a man is a name superior to beauty;

learning is better than hidden treasure.

Learning is a companion on a journey to a strange country,

learning is strength inexhaustible.

Learning is the source of renown

and the fountain of victory in the senate.

Learning is a superior sight,

learning is a livelihood;

a man without learning is as a beast of the field.

â€”Hitopa
