Early life

Silva was born in Lagos into an Amaro family of four children. Her mother, Adebimbola Silva, a pioneering doctor, died in July 2015. Her father was a lawyer. She attended Holy Child College in Lagos. At university she was part of a cultural group that included the playwright Bode Osanyin and the singer Stella Monye. Silva took a year off from her studies, during which time she began working as an actress. Silva then relocated to England, studying drama at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Initially her parents were opposed to Silva's decision to go into the theatre but they soon began to support her, happy at the success she made of her career. During a slow period of her career, she returned to school, studying English at the University of Lagos.

Career

Earlier roles (1990–2004)

Silva has starred in numerous films and television series in both the English and Yoruba languages. One of her earliest roles was in the 1990 English film Mind Bending.
In 1993 she appeared in Owulorojo, followed by Violated in 1995. In 1998 she starred opposite Colin Firth and Nia Long in the British-Canadian film The Secret Laughter of Women, in which she portrayed Nene. Author Finola Kerrigan noted than Silva stood out as an exceptional actress in the Nigerian film industry after mentioning her role.

In 2002, Silva starred opposite Bimbo Akintola in Keeping Faith. Akintola later cited Silva, whom she refers to as "Aunty Joke", as a major career influence, adding, "Silva has done a lot, but it's not even about the things that she did, it's about the things she didn't realize that she did". Also in 2002, Silva co-produced and starred in The Kingmaker with Olu Jacobs. This was followed by roles in pictures such as A Husband's Wife (2003), Shylock (2004), and A Past Came Calling (2004).

Critical success (2006–present)

In 2006, Silva was awarded the "Best Actress in a Leading Role" award at the 2nd Africa Movie Academy Awards for her role in Women's Cot.
Later that year, Silva starred opposite Genevieve Nnaji in Mildred Okwo's action thriller 30 Days, which received 10 nominations at the Africa Movie Academy Awards in 2008. 
She also narrated Jeta Amata's Anglo-Nigerian production The Amazing Grace, which was shot in Calabar. The film was lauded by critics, and was nominated for 11 African Movie Academy Awards. The News noted Silva's "song-like voice,  provides insight to the actions".

In 2007, Silva starred opposite Kate Henshaw-Nuttal, Michael Okon and Fred Essien in Ndubuisi Okoh's To Love and to Hold. Silva won a Best Supporting Actress award in 2008 for her "methodical portrayal of a grandmother" in White Waters (2007), though she was not at the ceremony to receive her award in person.
In a November 2008 interview, Silva professed that "whenever she had to play an evil character in a film, she would pray and use Jesus as her 'hedge'". Silva is also the recipient of an EMOTAN Award from African Independent Television (AIT) and the SOLIDRA Award for Visual Art.

In 2011, Silva starred alongside Nse Ikpe Etim, Wale Ojo and Lydia Forson in Kunle Afolayan's romantic comedy Phone Swap.

It also won the award for Achievement in Production Design.

Two shows were put on at 3 pm and 6 pm on 21, 22, 28 and 29 December, which Vanguard described as a "rich blend of folklore, traditional dance and music that naturally transports the audience to a typical African village setting".
