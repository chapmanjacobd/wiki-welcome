"This article is about plant transpiration. For transpiration in human and animal physiology, see Sweating and Hyperhydrosis.

Overview of transpiration: Water is passively transported into the roots and then into the xylem.

The forces of cohesion and adhesion cause the water molecules to form a column in the xylem.

Water moves from the xylem into the mesophyll cells, evaporates from their surfaces and leaves the plant by diffusion through the stomata
