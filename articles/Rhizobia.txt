"This article is about the generic term that includes species in other genera. For the bacterial genus, see Rhizobium.

Root nodules, each containing billions of Rhizobiaceae bacteria

Rhizobia are diazotrophic bacteria that fix nitrogen after becoming established inside the root nodules of legumes (Fabaceae). To express genes for nitrogen fixation, rhizobia require a plant host; they cannot independently fix nitrogen. In general, they are gram negative, motile, non-sporulating rods.
