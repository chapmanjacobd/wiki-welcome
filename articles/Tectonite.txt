L-S tectonite viewed in the plane of the S fabric

L-S tectonite viewed perpendicular to the plane of the S fabric

Deformed conglomerate showing no strain in one plane and strong stretching in the other â€“ an L-tectonite

Tectonites are metamorphic or tectonically deformed rocks whose fabric reflects the history of their deformation, or rocks with fabric that clearly displays coordinated geometric features that indicate continuous solid (ductile) flow during formation. Planar foliation results
