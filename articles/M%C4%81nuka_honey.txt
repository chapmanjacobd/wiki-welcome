A bowl of mānuka honey

Mānuka honey is a monofloral honey produced from the nectar of the mānuka tree, Leptospermum scoparium. There is no conclusive evidence of medicinal or dietary value in using mānuka honey other than as a sweetener. The word mānuka is the Māori name of the tree; the spelling manuka (without a macron) is common in English.
