Fabric scrunchies.

Scrunchies made from bead crochet.

A scrunchie (or scrunchy) is a fabric covered elastic hair tie used to fasten medium to long hair types. Large, elaborate styles and diminutive, unassuming forms are available in many different colors, fabrics, and designs. Although scrunchies are most commonly used in hair, they can also be worn around the wrist or ankle as an accessory to enhance an outfit.
