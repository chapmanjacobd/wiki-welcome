Emirates, (Arabic: طَيَران الإمارات‎ DMG: Ṭayarān Al-Imārāt), is a state-owned airline and flag carrier of the United Arab Emirates and is based in Garhoud, Dubai. The airline is a subsidiary of The Emirates Group, which is owned by the government of Dubai's Investment Corporation of Dubai. It is the largest airline in the UAE and the Middle East, operating over 3,600 flights per week from its hub at Terminal 3 of Dubai International Airport, to more than 150 cities in 80 countries across six continents through its fleet of nearly 300 aircraft. Cargo activities are undertaken by Emirates SkyCargo.

Emirates is the world's fourth largest airline by scheduled revenue passenger-kilometers flown, and the second-largest in terms of freight tonne kilometers flown.

During the mid-1980s, Gulf Air began to cut back its services to Dubai. As a result, Emirates was conceived in March 1985 with backing from Dubai's royal family, with Pakistan International Airlines providing two of the airline's first aircraft on wet-lease. With $10 million in start-up capital it was required to operate independently of government subsidy. Pakistan International Airlines provided training facilities to Emirates' cabin crew at its academy. The airline was headed by Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the airline's present chairman. In the years following its founding, the airline expanded both its fleet and its destinations. In October 2008, Emirates moved all operations at Dubai International Airport to Terminal 3.

Emirates operates a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing wide-body aircraft and is one of the few airlines to operate an all-wide-body aircraft fleet (while excluding Emirates Executive). As of February 2019, Emirates is the largest Airbus A380 operator with 115 aircraft in service and a further 8 on order. Since its introduction, the Airbus A380 has become an integral part of the Emirates fleet, especially on long-haul, high-density routes. Emirates is also the world's largest Boeing 777 operator with 155 aircraft in service.

History

Main article: History of Emirates (airline)

Corporate management

Two Emirates flight attendants.

The airline is a subsidiary of The Emirates Group, which itself is a subsidiary of the Dubai government's investment company, Investment Corporation of Dubai. The airline has recorded a profit every year, except the second year, and the growth has never fallen below 20% a year. In its first 11 years, it doubled in size every 3.5 years, and has every four years since.

In 2015 Emirates paid dividends worth AED2.6 billion (US$708 million), compared to AED1 billion (US$272 million) in 2014. The government has received Dhs14.6 billion from Emirates since dividends started being paid in 1999 for having provided an initial start-up capital of US$10 million and an additional investment of about US$80 million at the time of the airline's inception. The Dubai government is the sole owner of the company. However, it does not put any new money into it, nor does it interfere with running the airline.

Structure and employment

Main article: Emirates subsidiaries

Emirates has diversified into related industries and sectors, including airport services, engineering, catering, and tour operator operations. Emirates has seven subsidiaries and its parent company has more than 50. At the end of the fiscal year on 31 March 2020, the company employed a total of 59,519 staff of which 21,789 were cabin crew, 4,313 were flight deck crew, 3,316 were in engineering, 12,627 were listed as other, 5,376 employees were at overseas stations and 12,098 were at subsidiary companies.:72 Emirates' parent company, The Emirates Group, employed a total of 105,730 employees.:184

Emirates provides its employees with benefits such as comprehensive health plans and paid maternity and sick leave. Another strategy employed by Emirates is to use profit sharing and merit pay as part of its competency based approach to performance management.

Environmental record

The airline claims to have lower emissions than other airlines due to its fleet which has an average fuel burn of less than four litres for every 100 passenger kilometers it flies. The cargo division of the airline uses a similar hub-and-spoke network of operations.

Fleet efficiency

Emirates has stated that its versions of the A380-800 will offer fuel economy of 3.1 litres per 100 passenger km.

The company uses a program called "Flextracks". The technology is used to plan and optimize routes efficiency and load factor. Passenger load factors were 81.2% in the 6 months to September 2010.

Emirates has invested in a program called "tailored arrivals". This allows air traffic control to uplink to aircraft en route. It first determines the speed and flight profile from the air onto the runway, this allows the crew to accept and fly a continuous descent profile, saving fuel and emissions.

Financial and operational performance

In the financial year 2019-20, Emirates generated revenues of around AED 92.0 billion ($25.1 billion), which represented a decrease of approximately 6% over the previous year's revenues of AED 97.9 billion. Passenger numbers also decreased from 58.6 million to 56.2 million over the same period representing a decrease of around 4%. Passenger seat factor increased by 1.7%pts to 78.5%. Cargo carried in 2019-20 also declined, by 10% to 2.4 million tonnes (2018-19: 2.7 million tonnes). The airline's profits for the 2019/20 fiscal year rose by 21% to AED 1.1 billion ($25.1 billion) on the back of the lower oil prices and strong US dollar, although the 45-day runway closure at Dubai International and COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected results.:9

Its parent company saw profits down 28% to $0.5 billion for the year to 31 March.

As of March 2020, Emirates is using fuel price hedging. Fuel was 29.1% of total costs, and employee related costs were 13.4% of total costs.:66,83

The airline was the third-largest airline in the world in terms of international passengers carried,:19 and the largest:20 in the world in terms of scheduled international passenger-kilometers flown. It is also the second-largest in terms of scheduled freight tonne-kilometers flown (first in scheduled international freight tonne-kilometers flown).:22

Emirates' financial success has been attributed to rapid growth in demand for air travel in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia; the airline's investment in state-of-the-art aircraft, and the availability of airport capacity that can be used 24 hours a day.

Branding

Emirates' logo (in Arabic) painted on one of their Airbus A380-800s' engines.

An Emirates Boeing 777-300ER (painted the Expo 2020 Orange Livery) at Sydney Airport.

In the 1990s, Emirates launched its first set of commercials with the slogan So be good to yourself, Fly Emirates. In 1999, it launched a very rare A330-200 launch commercial with different pictures showing its aircraft with the original logo and the current logo (which was launched a few months before).

Commercials have reappeared in 2002, though the airline would not adopt the slogan Fly Emirates. Keep Discovering until 2004. In 2008, Emirates launched a slogan mainly revolving around its route network of 100 destinations in 59+ countries across six continents – Fly Emirates. Keep Discovering and Fly Emirates. To over Six Continents. Emirates currently uses the slogan Fly Better.

Emirates introduced a new design in August 2008 for its 16,000 uniformed staff, designed by Simon Jersey. The offboard uniform includes the Emirates hat, red kick-pleats in the skirts, more fitted blouses and the return of red leather shoes and handbags. For the onboard uniform, male and female cabin crew wear service waistcoats in place of the previously worn service jackets and tabards. The male flight attendants wear a chocolate brown suit, featuring pinstripes, with a cream shirt and a caramel, honey and red tie. Both male and female pursers wear this chocolate brown color, but with no red featured.

Since its formation in 1985, though to a limited extent until all aircraft were repainted, Emirates aeroplanes carried a section of the United Arab Emirates flag on the tail fins, a calligraphy of the logo in Arabic on the engines and the "Emirates" logo on the fuselage both in Arabic and English. The colour scheme used since 1985 was changed in November 1999 to the one still in use today. This change saw the modification of logotype, the enlargement and move of the English logo (the Arabic remaining smaller) towards the front of the aircraft and a different, flowing flag on the tailfin.

In 2011, Emirates sponsored the Emirates Air Line cable car over the River Thames in East London.

Since 2015, Emirates has sponsored the England-based Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, on the south coast. The airline did have £3.5m worth of plans to paint the landmark red, but after some discussion with the residents of Portsmouth and Southsea, Emirates agreed the tower was to be coloured blue and gold, with red lettering of the Emirates sponsor, for the pure reason that Portsmouth F.C. (the local football team) is coloured blue. It is now named "Emirates Spinnaker Tower".

In May 2015, Emirates operated over 3,000 flights every week across its network of over 140 destinations in over 70 countries across six continents from its hub in Dubai. Prior to suspensions due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, Emirates' global network spanned 157 destinations in 83 countries.

Alliance

Emirates is not a member of any of the three global airline alliances – Oneworld, SkyTeam or Star Alliance. In 2000 the airline briefly considered joining Star Alliance, but opted to remain independent. The reasoning for this was later revealed by senior vice-president of the airline's commercial operations worldwide that, "Your ability to react in the marketplace is hindered because you need a consensus from your alliance partners".

Emirates Executive

Emirates Executive was launched in 2013 for corporate and private charters. It operates a single Airbus ACJ319 business jet, accommodating 19 people. It features a mix of private suites and seating, a lounge, dining area and bathrooms with full height showers.

Fleet

Main article: Emirates fleet

As of July 2020, Emirates operates a fleet of 255 passenger aircraft and 11 cargo aircraft operated by Emirates SkyCargo. Emirates operates the largest fleet of both the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft in the world, with one A319 as an executive jet. Emirates has had no narrow-body aircraft in its mainline fleet since 1995.

In July 2014, Emirates finalized an order for 150 Boeing 777X aircraft (this number later reduced, see below), consisting of 35 777-8s and 115 777-9s, and, as of October 2017, was expected to become the launch operator for the 777X in mid-2020. In November 2017, it signed a commitment for 40 787-10s, but by early 2019 it was considering cancelling this order due to engine margins being insufficient for the hot Dubai weather, in favour of the A350.

In February 2019, Emirates signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s, while reducing its total A380 order to 8 after which Airbus will cease production of the A380. In November 2019, Emirates announced an order of 50 A350-900s worth US$16 billion that superseded the February memorandum of understanding. Also in November, Emirates ordered 30 787-9s with a value of US$8.8 billion with deliveries to commence in 2023, while reducing its order of 777Xs from 150 to 126. In December, Emirates reduced further 777X orders from 126 to 115.

Livery

Current livery (1999–present)

The current livery features a UAE flag on the vertical stabilizer and a white fuselage, with the golden word "Emirates" painted on the upper fuselage was introduced in November 1999 on the Boeing 777-300 and on all Airbus A330 aircraft that were delivered from November 1999. The livery rolled out shortly after on the rest of the Emirates fleet and Emirates completed repainting aircraft to the current livery by 2005. The current livery also kept the Arabic company name but the font size is smaller than the one from the old livery. The Emirates logo in Arabic is painted gold on all engines.

Former livery (1985–1999)

The former livery of Emirates was the same as the current one, except that the font was Times New Roman and it was relatively smaller, located on the top of the windows. There was also the Arabic company name painted. All aircraft wearing the old livery were repainted or retired. The old livery was retired by 2005 as the last aircraft with the old livery (an Airbus A310-300) was repainted to the current livery.

Cabin

First Class

There are two types of first class seating; the fully enclosed suite with a ceiling to floor door and a private suite with doors that close but don't extend to the ceiling. Both suites come complete with closing doors to ensure privacy, a mini-bar, a coat rack and storage. They also feature the ICE system on a 23-inch-wide (58 cm) LCD screen in the private suites and a 32-inch-wide (81 cm) on the fully enclosed suite. The seat converts into a 2-metre-long (79 in) fully flat bed. Private suites are available on 3-class Airbus A380-800 and 3-class Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. The fully enclosed suites are available on its newly delivered Boeing 777-300ER aircraft.

On its newly delivered Airbus A380-800, First class features private suites, two shower-equipped lavatories and spa, and access to the first/business class bar area and lounge. Premium class seating is located on the entire upper deck of A380-800 aircraft.

Emirates introduced a new First Class cabin for its Boeing 777-300ER fleet on 12 November 2017 and first flight to Brussels and Geneva on 1 December 2017. The new First Class cabin is configured with six suites on a 1-1-1 layout. The middle suites come with virtual windows that project live feed from the outside of the aircraft on real time. Both the middle suites are equipped with 3 virtual windows which are high definition LCD screens which relay real time image using the HD cameras on either side of the aircraft. Amenities include 2 minibars placed on either side of the entertainment screen, a 13inch tablet with a front camera to communicate with the cabin crew and to order room service. A panel to control the lighting and temperature inside the suite. Emirates has also introduced a new seat in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz, which feature a new zero-gravity position. The suites are expected to resemble "a private bedroom on a luxury yacht".

Business Class

Business class on Boeing 777-200LRs and Boeing 777-300ERs feature seats with a 1.5-metre-long (60 in) pitch that recline to 2-metre-long (79 in), angled lie-flat beds. Amenities include massage function, privacy partition, winged headrest with six-way movement, two individual reading lights and an overhead light per seat, in-seat power supply, USB Ports and an RCA socket for laptop connection, over 600 channels of entertainment on ICE, shown on a 23 in-wide (58 cm) HD TV screen.

On Airbus A380-800 aircraft, the seats recline to form a fully flat bed and are equipped with personal mini-bars. Due to the unique staggered layout, half of the business class seats on Emirates A380 are 23 cm (9 in) shorter than the others, at only 1.8 m (70 in) long. Business class passengers also have access to an on-board bar at the rear of the aircraft.

Premium Economy Class

Despite the fact that currently, no aircraft in Emirates' fleet has a Premium Economy Class on board, one is set to be introduced alongside the delivery of Emirates' first Boeing 777X (around 2020–2021). These seats are also set to be fitted on the airline's Airbus A380s around 2020–2021 and Boeing 777-300ERs. Multiple sources theorize that the seats may be HAECO's Eclipse Cabin, while others speculate that they may be more "conventional" ones, but it is still unknown what seat type the airline will use.

Economy Class

Emirates Economy class offers a 79–81-centimetre-long (31–32 in) seat pitch on Airbus aircraft and 86 cm (34 in) on Boeing aircraft and standard seat width (except on the Boeing 777 fleet). Emirates has ten seats per row on its Boeing 777 fleet. The seat features adjustable headrests, a 3000 channel ICE In-Flight-Entertainment and in-seat laptop power-outlets on newer aircraft and laptop recharging facilities in galleys in older aircraft. There is additional recline on A380 Economy class seats.

Catering

Catering on Emirates flights from Dubai International is provided by Emirates Flight Catering which operates one of the largest airline catering facilities in the world. Emirates also offers special meal options, in all classes, based on age, dietary restrictions, preference and religious observance. Special meals must be ordered in advance, at least 24 hours before the flight departure time. All meals, however, are prepared according to Halal dietary guidelines.
In June 2018, Emirates signed a $40 million joint venture with Oakland, California-based Crop One Holdings, to build and maintain the world's largest hydroponic growing facility. It will provide daily yields of roughly 3 tons of leafy greens per day to all flights, with a near 150,000 square foot indoor, vertical farm.

In-flight entertainment system

Emirates became one of the first group of airlines in the world to introduce a personal entertainment system on a commercial aircraft in 1992, shortly after Virgin Atlantic introduced a similar system throughout the cabins of its aircraft in 1991. All three classes feature a personal in-flight entertainment (IFE) system on Emirates aircraft. There are two types of entertainment system on Emirates: ICE and ICE Digital Widescreen.

In 2012, Emirates introduced larger high definition IFE screens in all classes. The new IFE is the first to be fully high definition, and in economy, the screens are the largest offered by any airline. The new IFE will only be installed on the Airbus A380 fleet and the newly delivered Boeing 777s.

ICE

ICE (Information, Communication, Entertainment) is the in-flight entertainment system operated by Emirates.

Introduced in 2003, ICE is available on all new aircraft and now features 4,000 channels (on most flights) to all passengers. ICE is found on the airline's Airbus A380-800, Boeing 777-200LR and Boeing 777-300ER.

In July 2007, Emirates introduced ICE Digital Widescreen, an updated version of ICE. It offered over 1200 channels of pre-selected entertainment available to all passengers. ICE Digital Widescreen is available on all new aircraft.

In 2015 Emirates upgraded its ICE – inflight entertaining system to the new eX3 system which includes new upgrades that improved passenger experience, such as Handset with more controls, larger screens, new sockets, some 3,500 channels of movies, TV shows, music and games, on demand and in multiple languages, new ICE features, such as a Voyager app, Bluetooth audio and personal video playback. This is fitted in 2009 onward aircraft B777 and A380 as well as installed on new aircraft that will be delivered to the airline.

Information

The system is based on the 3000i system from Panasonic Avionics Corporation. ICE provides passengers with a direct data link to BBC News. ICE is the first IFE system to be connected directly to automatic news updates. This is complemented by ICE's Airshow moving-map software from Rockwell Collins. Exterior cameras located on the aircraft can be viewed by any passenger, through the IFE system, during takeoff, cruise and landing. Emirates was also one of the first airlines to introduce high-speed, in-flight Internet service along with Singapore Airlines, by installing the Inmarsat's satellite system and became the second airline in the world to offer live international television broadcasts using the same system.

Communication

ICE has a link to an in-flight email server which allows passengers to access, send or receive emails for US$1 per message. ICE also supports a seat-to-seat chat service. In November 2006 the airline signed a deal with mobile communications firm AeroMobile to allow in-flight use of mobile phones to call or text people on the ground. The service was first introduced in March 2008.

Entertainment

The ICE system includes movies, music, and video games. ICE offers over 600 on-demand movie titles, over 2000 video on demand and prerecorded television channels, over 1000 hours of music and over 100 video-game titles. ICE can be accessed in more than 40 languages including English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Korean, Tamil, Thai, Italian and Japanese. Since 2003 all entertainment options are available on demand to all classes with options to pause, forward, and rewind them. The entertainment selections do not include LGBT-themed options.

Emirates began to offer docking capability for Apple Inc.'s iPod portable music and video player in mid-2007. This allows the device's battery to be charged, and integrates with Emirates' in-flight entertainment (IFE) system. The IFE system can play music, television shows, or movies stored on the iPod, and function as a control system.

Ground services

Passengers may check-in between two and 24 hours prior to at Dubai International Airport, as well as at certain stations of the Dubai Metro. All Emirates Flights are now operated exclusively from Terminal 3 at Dubai International Airport

Lounges

First and business class passengers, and Skywards Platinum and Gold members have access to 33 Emirates lounges in 32 cities. Skywards Silver members can use the lounges at Dubai Airport only. At airports in which Emirates does not operate a departure lounge, a third-party departure lounge is usually provided for First and Business class passengers and Skywards Platinum and Gold members.

Chauffeur-drive

Complimentary chauffeur driven airport transfers are available to Business and First Class passengers in over 75 cities to airports.

In Dubai, Emirates uses the new BMW 5 Series Touring car for Business Class passengers, and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan for First Class passengers.

In other countries, the type of vehicle varies depending on the location and service provider that the airline has contracted.

Frequent-flyer program

Main article: The Emirates Group § Loyalty programs

Emirates Skywards is the frequent-flyer program of Emirates launched in the year 2000. The program had over 16 million members as of 2016. The program uses two separate points systems – Skywards Miles as the currency that can be redeemed for benefits, and Tier Miles as the metric that determines a member's tier status.

There are four tiers – Blue, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Once any customer registers, he or she becomes a Blue member. This registration is free of any charges. Silver tier requires 25,000 Tier Miles, Gold tier requires 50,000 Tier Miles and Platinum tier requires 150,000 Tier Miles for qualification respectively.

Emirates Skywards has partners across airlines, banks, hotels, car rentals and retail/lifestyle verticals.

As of 2016 Emirates has frequent-flyer partnerships with: Alaska Airlines, easyJet, Japan Airlines, Jet Airways, JetBlue, Jetstar, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, S7 Airlines, South African Airways, TAP Portugal, Virgin America, Air Mauritius and GOL.

Emirates Skywards has partnered with Starwood Preferred Guest (also known as SPG, the loyalty program of Starwood Hotels and Resorts) to bring its members Your World Rewards. This allows Emirates Skywards members to earn both Skywards Miles and Starpoints (the loyalty currency for SPG program) when they either fly with Emirates to over 150 destinations or stay at any of SPG's 1,200 Starwood Hotels and Resorts.

Another noteworthy partnership is Emirates Skywards partnership with Dubai Duty Free (DDF) which was launched in 2016. This partnership allows members to spend their Skywards Miles at participating Dubai Duty Free outlets when they travel through Dubai airports. Members can redeem their Skywards Miles for duty-free products at Dubai International airport and Al Maktoum International at Dubai South. Redemptions start from 4,500 Skywards Miles (worth AED 100), and members can instantly redeem Skywards Miles at the checkout. Each additional Dirham (AED) is equivalent to 45 Skywards Miles, and there is no upper limit to the number of Skywards Miles that can be spent.

From 28 August 2016, Emirates Skywards enabled its members to use Miles or a combination of Cash+Miles (C+M) to pay for an EK published fare as a form of payment.

This benefit allows members to redeem a minimum of 2000 Skywards Miles and a maximum of total amount of base fare in Skywards Miles. Cash+Miles is used as a form of payment for the base fare only and excludes taxes and carrier imposed charges. This benefit is available on Emirates flights only and not available on any other airlines with which Emirates has a codeshare agreement.

Cash+Miles offers Emirates Skywards members more choice and flexibility when it comes to spending their Skywards Miles. This is available in all classes and is applicable to all fare types.

Business model

Main article: Emirates business model

The established network carriers in Europe and Australia, i.e. Air France-KLM, British Airways, Lufthansa, and Qantas, perceive Emirates' strategic decision to reposition itself as a global carrier as a major threat because it enables air travellers to bypass traditional airline hubs such as London-Heathrow, Paris-CDG, and Frankfurt on their way between Europe/North America and Asia/Australia by changing flights in Dubai instead. These carriers also find it difficult to deal with the growing competitive threat Emirates poses to their business because of their much higher cost base.

Some of these carriers, notably Air France and Qantas, have accused Emirates of receiving hidden state subsidies and of maintaining too cozy a relationship with Dubai's airport authority and its aviation authority, both of which are also wholly state-owned entities that share the same government owner with the airline. Qantas' chairman claimed that Emirates is able to reduce its borrowing costs below market rates by taking advantage of its government shareholders' sovereign borrower status. Emirates' president disagrees and has also referred to United States airlines bankruptcy protection as being a substantial form of state assistance. The airline makes regular profits. In 2016, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, and United Airlines have made similar claims as well as stating that they violate Open Skies but these conflicts were resolved in May 2018.

In May 2010, Emirates Airline executives refuted claims that the carrier does not pay taxes and receives substantial financial assistance from the Dubai government. They claimed that the airline received $80m in cash and kind in the 25 years since the airline was established and this was substantially lower than what other national carriers had received. Maurice Flanagan also claimed that Emirates incurred social costs of around $600m in 2009 and this included municipal taxes to the city of Dubai. The airline also paid a dividend of AED956m ($260m) in 2010, compared to AED2.9bn ($793m) in 2009 and each year the Government has received at least $100m in dividends.

Emirates also faces competition from other middle-eastern airlines, mainly Qatar Airways and the Abu Dhabi-based, Etihad.

Accidents and incidents

Emirates have experienced several incidents of aircraft (none with passenger or crew fatalities).

On 9 April 2004, Flight 764, an Airbus A340-300 operating from Johannesburg to Dubai sustained serious damage during takeoff when it failed to become airborne before the end of the runway, striking RWY 25 approach lights, causing four tires to burst which in turn threw debris into various parts of the aircraft, ultimately damaging the flap drive mechanism. This rendered the flaps immovable in the takeoff position. The aircraft returned for an emergency landing during which the normal braking system failed as a result of the damage. The aircraft was brought to a stop only 250 meters from the end of the 3,400 meter runway using reverse thrust and the alternative braking system. In their report, South African investigators found that the captain had used a wrong take-off technique, and criticized Emirates training and rostering practices.

On 20 March 2009, Emirates Flight 407, an Airbus A340-500 registered A6-ERG en route from Melbourne to Dubai failed to take off properly at Melbourne Airport, hitting several structures at the end of the runway before eventually climbing enough to return to the airport for a safe landing. There were no injuries, but the incident was severe enough to be classified as an accident by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.

On 3 August 2016, Emirates Flight 521, a Boeing 777-300 registered A6-EMW arriving from Trivandrum International Airport, crash-landed and caught fire at Dubai International Airport at 12:44 PM local time. All 282 passengers and 18 crew on board survived the impact with some having minor injuries. However, an airport firefighter died fighting the blaze. The aircraft was destroyed by the fire. Flight 521 was the first hull loss in the history of Emirates.

On 22 August 2019, an A380-861 registered A6-EOP was damaged inside a hangar during routine maintenance when the nose gear collapsed, causing extensive structural damage to the front-section of the fuselage. The aircraft was repaired over a period of roughly six months and returned to service on 3 March 2020.
