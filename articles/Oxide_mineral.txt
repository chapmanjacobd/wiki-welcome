Oxide mineral exhibit at the Museum of Geology in South Dakota

The oxide mineral class includes those minerals in which the oxide anion (O2âˆ’) is bonded to one or more metal alloys. The hydroxide-bearing minerals are typically included in the oxide class. The minerals with complex anion groups such as the silicates, sulfates, carbonates and phosphates are classed separately.
