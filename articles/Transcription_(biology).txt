Process of copying a segment of DNA into RNA

Simplified diagram of mRNA synthesis and processing. Enzymes not shown.

Transcription is the first of several steps of DNA based gene expression in which a particular segment of DNA is copied into RNA (especially mRNA) by the enzyme RNA polymerase. 

Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, which use base pairs of nucleotides as a complementary
