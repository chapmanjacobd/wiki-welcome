Dadès Gorges

The Dadès Gorges (Arabic: وادي دادس‎, romanized: wādī dādis; French: Gorges du Dadès, pronounced ) are a series of rugged wadi gorges carved out by the Dadès River in Morocco. The river originates in the High Atlas range of the Atlas mountains, flowing some 350 kilometres (220 mi) southwest before joining the Draa River at the edge of the Sahara. The many-colored walls of the gorges range anywhere from 200 to 500 meters (650 to 1600 feet).
