This article is about high-pressure physics of minerals. For physical attributes of minerals like cleavage, see Mineralogy ยง Physical properties.

Mineral physics is the science of materials that compose the interior of planets, particularly the Earth. It overlaps with petrophysics, which focuses on whole-rock properties. It provides information that allows interpretation of surface measurements of seismic waves, gravity anomalies,
