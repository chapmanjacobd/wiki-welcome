Haganah paramilitaries in 1948 using long guns.

A long gun is a category of firearms with longer barrels than most other types. In small arms, a long gun is generally designed to be held by both hands and braced against the shoulder, in contrast to a handgun, which can be fired being held with a single hand. In the context of cannons and mounted firearms an artillery long gun would be contrasted with a howitzer or carronade.
