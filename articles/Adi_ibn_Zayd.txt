"Adi ibn Zayd al-Ibadi (Arabic: عَدِيُّ بْنُ زَيْدٍ العِبَادِيُّ‎, romanized: ʿAdī ibn Zayd al-ʿIbādī) was a 6th-century Arab Christian poet from an Ibadi family of al-Hirah.

He was married to the granddaughter of the Lakhmid ruler al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir (r. 580–602), and is said to have helped al-Nu'man accede to power as ruler of al-Hirah. He also served as the secretary (dabir) for Arab affairs under the Sasanian king Hormizd IV (r. 579–590).
