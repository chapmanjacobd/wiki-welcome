Fig. 1 Imbricate fan in a thrust system with a basal décollement. The section below the décollement is undeformed basement rock. Above the décollement, deformation has occurred due to compression. A series of branching faults terminating at depth.

Décollement (from French décoller, meaning 'to detach from') is a gliding plane between two rock masses, also known as a basal detachment fault. Décollements are a deformational structure, resulting in independent styles of deformation in the ro
