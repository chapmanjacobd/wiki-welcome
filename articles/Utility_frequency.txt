"Frequency used on standard electricity grid in a given area

The waveform of 230 volt, 50 Hz compared with 110 V, 60 Hz

The utility frequency, (power) line frequency (American English) or mains frequency (British English) is the nominal frequency of the oscillations of alternating current (AC) in a wide area synchronous grid transmitted from a power station to the end-user. In large parts of the world this is 50 Hz, although in the Americas and parts of Asia it is typically 60 Hz. Current usag
