"Molecule triggering an immune response (antibody production) in the host

An illustration that shows how antigens induce the immune system response by interacting with an antibody that matches the antigen's molecular structure.

In immunology, an antigen (Ag) is a molecule or molecular structure, such as may be present at the outside of a pathogen, that can be bound to by an antigen-specific antibody (Ab) or B cell antigen receptor (BCR). The presence of antigens in the body normally triggers a
