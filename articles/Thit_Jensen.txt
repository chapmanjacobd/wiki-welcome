Maria Kirstine Dorothea Jensen (Thit Jensen) (19 January 1876 – 14 May 1957) was a Danish novelist, but also author of short stories, plays and society-critical articles.

She was the daughter of a veterinarian in Farsø and sister to Danish author Johannes V. Jensen. She was married from 1912–1918 to the painter Gustav Fenger.

She wrote about erotic and social themes and fought for women's rights. In 1917 she founded Københavns Husmoderforening (Copenhagen Housewives Association) and in 1917 De Danske Husmoderforeninger (The Danish Housewives Association) which represented all the local associations in Denmark. 
In 1924 she founded the "Foreningen for Seksuel Oplysning", the Organization for Sexual Awareness, in which Jonathan Leunbach performed abortions. She was personally against abortion, but felt that women needed to have a choice. She was highly criticized for this belief.

Jensen was awarded the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat in 1935 and with the Holberg Medal in 1940.
