Chickpeas

Two varieties of chickpea: the larger light tan Kabuli and variously coloured Desi chickpea. They are green when picked early and vary through tan or beige, speckled, dark brown to black. 75% of world production is of the smaller desi type. The larger garbanzo bean or hoummus was introduced into India in the 18th century.
