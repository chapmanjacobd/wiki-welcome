"The sediments accreted onto the non-subducting tectonic plate at a convergent plate boundary

Diagram of the geological process of subduction

An accretionary wedge or accretionary prism forms from sediments accreted onto the non-subducting tectonic plate at a convergent plate boundary. Most of the material in the accretionary wedge consists of marine sediments scraped off from the downgoing slab of oceanic crust, but in some cases the wedge includes the erosional products of volcanic island ar
