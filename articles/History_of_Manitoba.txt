Canadian provinces 1867–2003

Manitoba is one of Canada's ten provinces, and the easternmost of the Prairie Provinces. A traditional territory of several First Nations, European fur traders first arrived in what is now Manitoba during the late 17th century, with the French under La Vérendrye setting up several trading post forts in the area. In 1670, Britain declared sovereignty over the watershed of Hudson's Bay, making it part of Rupert's Land under the authority of the Hudson's Bay Company
