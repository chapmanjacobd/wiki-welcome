"The movement of solid particles, typically by gravity and fluid entrainment

Dust blows from the Sahara Desert over the Atlantic Ocean towards the Canary Islands.

Sediment transport is the movement of solid particles (sediment), typically due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment, and/or the movement of the fluid in which the sediment is entrained. Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are clastic rocks (sand, gravel, boulders, etc.), mud, or clay; the f
