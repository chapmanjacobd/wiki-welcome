A coupé or coupe is a passenger car with a sloping or truncated rear roofline and generally two doors (although several four-door cars have also been marketed as coupés).

Coupé was first applied to horse-drawn carriages for two passengers without rear-facing seats. The term coupé comes from the French translation of "cut".
