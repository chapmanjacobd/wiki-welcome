The division of Earth by the Equator and prime meridian

In geography and cartography, the hemispheres of Earth refer to any division of the globe into two hemispheres (from Ancient Greek ἡμισφαίριον hēmisphairion, meaning "half of a sphere").

The most common such divisions are by latitudinal or longitudinal markers:

North–South
Northern Hemisphere, the half that lies north of the Equator

Southern Hemisphere, the half that lies south of the Equator

East–West
Eastern Hemisphe
