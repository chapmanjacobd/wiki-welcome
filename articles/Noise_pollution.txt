Traffic is the main source of noise pollution in cities (like Sao Paulo shown here) and other places.

A Qantas Boeing 747-400 passes close to houses shortly before landing at London Heathrow Airport.

Noise pollution, also known as environmental noise or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise with ranging impacts on the activity of human or animal life, most of them harmful to a degree. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport, and propagation systems.
