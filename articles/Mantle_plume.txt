"An upwelling of abnormally hot rock within the Earth's mantle

A superplume generated by cooling processes in the mantle (LVZ=low-velocity zone)

A mantle plume is a proposed mechanism of convection of abnormally hot rock within the Earth's mantle. Because the plume head partly melts on reaching shallow depths, a plume is often invoked as the cause of volcanic hotspots, such as Hawaii or Iceland, and large igneous provinces such as the Deccan and Siberian traps. Some such volcanic regions lie f
