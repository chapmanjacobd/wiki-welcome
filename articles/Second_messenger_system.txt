"System of signaling molecules within a cell

Second messengers are intracellular signaling molecules released by the cell in response to exposure to extracellular signaling moleculesâ€”the first messengers. (Intracellular signals, a non-local form or cell signaling, encompassing both first messengers and second messengers, are classified as juxtacrine, paracrine, and endocrine depending on the range of the signal.) Second messengers trigger physiological changes at cellular level such as prolif
