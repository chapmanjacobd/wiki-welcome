Early life and education

Kim's mother encouraged him to take acting classes during his high school years to help him overcome his introverted personality. His father is Kim Chung-hoon and was the lead singer of the 80's band "Seven Dolphins". He enrolled at Chung-Ang University's Film and Theater Department in 2009.

In 2015, it was revealed to the public that Kim has a paternal half-sister named Kim Ju-na, a singer. His cousin, Lee Sa-rang (real name Lee Jae-hyun), directed his latest film, Real (2017).

Career

2007–2010: Television career beginnings

Kim made his television debut with a supporting role in the 2007 family sitcom Kimchi Cheese Smile, and in 2008, landed a lead role in KBS's critically acclaimed youth drama, Jungle Fish. Based on a true story, it tackles the serious issues of school cheating, competitive academic standards, and interactive blogging in a fresh way. The drama won a number of awards, including the Peabody Award.

For the latter half of the year, Kim appeared in the food-based variety show Delicious Quiz (also known as The Taste of Life) as one of the hosts and in the short film Cherry Blossom.

In 2009, Kim acted in the short film Worst Friends by Namkoong Sun, which won the Best Film in Social Drama award at the Mise en Scène Short Film Festival and the well-received SBS drama special Father's House where he acted alongside veteran actor Choi Min-soo. 
He also co-hosted Mnet's Boys & Girls Music Countdown along with Kara's Han Seung-yeon in 2009.

Kim raised his profile through memorable turns as the younger version of the male lead characters in Will It Snow for Christmas? and Giant, the latter winning him the Best New Actor award at the SBS Drama Awards.

2011–2013: Rising popularity and breakthrough

In September 2014

Kim became a household name in 2011 after starring in teen musical drama Dream High. He plays a country bumpkin who turned out to be a musical genius. The drama brought in high domestic ratings and was also popular overseas, winning several international awards. As the only young actor in a cast of idols, Kim studied song and dance for three months at JYP Entertainment to pull off the required scenes in the drama. He recorded two songs for the drama's soundtrack, his solo "Dreaming" as well as the title track "Dream High" with the rest of the cast.

Kim's popularity skyrocketed when he starred in the hit period drama Moon Embracing the Sun as the young King Leehwon. The drama recorded a peak rating of 42.2 percent, thereby earning the "national drama" status. Kim contributed his vocals to the soundtrack with the traditional ballad "Only You" and the more modern composition "Another Way".

Due to his popularity, he set a new record in product endorsements for being the face of 17 products simultaneously. He also won the Best TV Actor award at the 2012 Baeksang Arts Awards. Beating out heavyweight veterans such as Han Suk-kyu, Shin Ha-kyun and Cha Seung-won, Kim said "I am very grateful for this moment, but I am ashamed as well. It's like getting a lot of homework. I'll keep trying to become a better actor in order to remain worthy of this award".

Kim made his big-screen debut in the star-studded heist film The Thieves, touted by the press as the Korean version of Ocean's Eleven. With over 12.9 million ticket sales, the film became the second highest-grossing movie in Korean film history.

In 2013, Kim was cast to play the role of a North Korean spy who infiltrated South Korea as a village idiot in the movie Secretly, Greatly, an adaptation of the popular webtoon series Covertness by Hun. The film broke several records and was one of the most successful box office hits of the year. Kim won Best New Actor awards at the 50th Grand Bell Awards and the 50th Baeksang Arts Awards.

2014–present: International fame

Baeksang Arts Awards May 2014

From 2013 to early 2014, Kim starred in SBS fantasy romance series My Love from the Star alongside Jun Ji-hyun. He also released two singles for the drama's soundtrack, titled "In Front of Your House" and "Promise".
The drama had over three billion hits on the Chinese streaming website iQiyi and also sparked trends in fashion, make-up and restaurants. Kim experienced explosive growth in popularity throughout Asia and became one of the most in-demand endorsers with 35 product endorsements. He won the Daesang (or "Grand Prize"), the highest award for television, at the 7th Korea Drama Awards.

For the latter half of the year, Kim attended two international sports events. Held on 16 August 2014, Kim sang the official theme song "Light up the Future" with several artists at the opening ceremony of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympic Games held in Nanjing, China. He also participated in the opening ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. Along with actor Jang Dong-gun, Korean opera singer Ahn Sook-sun and people from 45 nations, they delivered the message of "One Asia" at the second part of the highlight stage.

In 2015, Kim starred in KBS' variety drama The Producers, written by My Love From the Star writer Park Ji-eun. The drama drew solid domestic ratings domestically, and was also sold to several countries internationally. Kim once again won the Daesang (or "Grand Prize") at the 8th Korea Drama Awards, 4th APAN Star Awards and the 2015 KBS Drama Awards for his acting performance.
Kim was listed under Forbes "30 Under 30 Asia 2016 list" which comprises 30 influential people under 30 years old who have made substantial effect in their fields.

Kim then starred in the action-noir film Real, which premiered in June 2017.

In December 2019, reports have surfaced that Kim is leaving KeyEast to form an agency with his cousin. In January 2020, Kim signed with Gold Medalist along with actors Kim Sae-ron and Seo Ye-ji. 

In 2020, Kim is set to star in the tvN drama It's Okay to Not Be Okay as a psychiatric aide. This will be his first small screen appearance in five years since The Producers.
