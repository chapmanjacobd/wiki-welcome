"This article is about rock cleavage. For cleavage in minerals, see Cleavage (crystal).

Different ways in which a cleavage can develop in a sedimentary rock. A: original sedimentary rock; B: pencil cleavage; C: diagenetic foliation (parallel to bedding); D: slaty cleavage.

Cleavage, in structural geology and petrology, describes a type of planar rock feature that develops as a result of deformation and metamorphism. The degree of deformation and metamorphism along with rock type determines the
