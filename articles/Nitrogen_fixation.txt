"Conversion of molecular nitrogen into biologically-accessible nitrogen compounds

Nitrogen fixation is a process by which molecular nitrogen in the air is converted into ammonia (NH

3) or related nitrogenous compounds in soil. Atmospheric nitrogen is molecular dinitrogen, a relatively nonreactive molecule that is metabolically useless to all but a few microorganisms. Biological nitrogen fixation converts N

2 into ammonia, which is metabolized by most organisms.
