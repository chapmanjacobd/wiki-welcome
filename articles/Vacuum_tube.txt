"Device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container

This article is about the electronic device. For experiments in an evacuated pipe, see Free fall. For the transport system, see Pneumatic tube.

Later thermionic vacuum tubes, mostly miniature style, some with top cap anode connections for higher voltages

A vacuum tube, an electron tube, or valve (British usage) or, colloquially, a tube (North America), is a device that controls electric current flow in a high
