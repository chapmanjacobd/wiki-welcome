Percy Sinclair Pilcher (16 January 1867 â€“ 2 October 1899) was a British inventor and pioneer aviator who was his country's foremost experimenter in unpowered flight at the end of the nineteenth century.

He was planning a flight with a motor-driven hang glider, but died in the crash of another glider before he could make the attempt.

His memorial is in a field opposite Stanford Hall in Leicestershire.
