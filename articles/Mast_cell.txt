Anatomical terms of microanatomy

A mast cell (also known as a mastocyte or a labrocyte) is a migrant cell of connective tissue that contains many granules rich in histamine and heparin. Specifically, it is a type of granulocyte derived from the myeloid stem cell that is a part of the immune and neuroimmune systems. Mast cells were discovered by Paul Ehrlich in 1877.
