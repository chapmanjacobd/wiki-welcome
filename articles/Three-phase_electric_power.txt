"Common electrical power generation, transmission and distribution method for alternating currents

Not to be confused with Split-phase electric power.

Three-phase transformer with four wire output for 208Y/120 volt service: one wire for neutral, others for A, B and C phases

Three-phase electric power is a common method of alternating current electric power generation, transmission, and distribution. It is a type of polyphase system and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldw
