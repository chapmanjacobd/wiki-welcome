Isocost v. isoquant graph. Each line segment is an isocost line representing one particular level of total input costs, denoted TC, with PL being the unit price of labor and PK the unit price of physical capital. The convex curves are isoquants, each showing various combinations of input usages that would give the particular output level designated by the particular isoquant. Tangency points show the lowest cost input combination for producing any given level of output. A curve connecting the ta
