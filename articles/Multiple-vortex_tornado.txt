A multiple-vortex tornado outside Dallas, Texas, on April 2, 1957.

A multiple-vortex tornado is a tornado that contains several vortices (called subvortices or suction vortices) revolving around, inside of, and as part of the main vortex. The only times multiple vortices may be visible are when the tornado is first forming or when condensation and debris are balanced such that subvortices are apparent without being obscured. T
