"Study and analysis of groups of sedimentary deposits

Sequence stratigraphy is a branch of geology that attempts to subdivide and link sedimentary deposits into unconformity bound units on a variety of scales and explain these stratigraphic units in terms of variations in sediment supply and variations in the rate of change in accommodation space (relative sea level, the combination of eustatic sea level and tectonic subsidence). The essence of the method is mapping of strata based on identific
