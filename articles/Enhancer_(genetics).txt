"DNA sequence that binds activators to increase the likelihood of gene transcription

Seen here is a four step diagram depicting the usage of an enhancer. Within this DNA sequence, protein(s) known as transcription factor(s) bind to the enhancer and increase the activity of the promoter. DNA

Transcription Activator Protein

Mediator Protein

RNA Polymerase

In genetics, an enhancer is a short (50â€“1500 bp) region of DNA that can be bound by proteins (activators) to in
