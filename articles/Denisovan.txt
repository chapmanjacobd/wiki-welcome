Asian archaic human

Denisova 4, a molar

The Denisovans or Denisova hominins ( /dɪˈniːsəvə/ di-NEE-sə-və) are an extinct species or subspecies of archaic human that ranged across Asia during the Lower and Middle Paleolithic (potentially surviving as late as 30,000–14,500 years ago in New Guinea). Denisovans are known from few remains, and, consequently, most of what is known about them comes from DNA evidence. Pen
