Guadalupe is a city and surrounding municipality located in the state of Nuevo León, in northern Mexico. It is part of the Greater Monterrey Metropolitan area.

The municipality of Guadalupe, which lies adjacent to the east side of Monterrey, also borders the municipalities of San Nicolás de los Garza, Apodaca, Pesquería, and Juárez. Covering a territory of 151.3 km2 (58.4 sq mi), it is located at 25°40′39″N 100°15′35″W / 25.67750°N 100.25972°W / 25.67750; -100.25972, 
at an altitude of 500 meters above sea level. As of the 2005 census its official population was 691,434 in the city and 691,931 in the entire municipality. It is the second-largest city and municipality in the state. The municipality has an area of 151.3 km2 (58.4 sq mi) (58.42 sq mi).

The city was founded on January 4, 1716, but the land was inhabited long before that. When Monterrey was founded in 1596, the land, which was populated by various indigenous tribes, was ceded to Diego de Montemayor, the founder of Monterrey, but he did not make use of the land. In 1627, the land was turned into large plantations, where sugar cane and corn was raised. The owner of the land during around the time of the turn of the 18th century was named Capitán Nicolás Ochoa de Elejalde, but the land was taken from him by the Spanish government and converted into a mission in February, 1715. In 1756, the city was renamed the "Pueblo de la Nueva Tlaxcala de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Horcasitas". On March 5, 1825, the city was declared a municipality of Nuevo León and categorized as a villa, even though for many years it continued to be called the "Villa de Guadalupe".

Employer party 

The patron feast is the second Sunday of the month of August, the patron of the town is the Lord of the Expiration that is in the Ancient Temple of the same name. He is also called the lord of the rain; For the celebration there are various activities accompanied by music and dance, all this in the main square of the municipality, the mornings are sung at about 10:00 pm, and then continue with the pyrotechnics.

Legend:
... It happened in one morning, when the first light of dawn was barely visible. The Indians woke up startled and rushed to the Chapel, because they heard the bell ringing. And his shock was even greater, when he realized that it was not the Indian Sacristan who sounded it, but an ass that moved his neck and pulled the rope with his snout.
Heavy load brought the beast on its backs. - some merchant will have lost it - they said, but in vain they looked in the way; They didn't even find a recent trace of any trace on the path.
Although with the ensuing fear, they freed the borrico from such weight; and when they laid down the drawer lake of rough and badly interlocked boards, they noticed that its content was a picture of the crucified and life-sized Lord. Bowing down with fennel before such a providential visit; some cried, moved by the expression of the face of the Lord; others crossed themselves with a gesture of amazement and joy.
They introduced the Christ into the Chapel, replacing with him the great wooden cross that stood out at the bottom, and which had been venerated until then as the holder of the primitive estate.
So overwhelming was the jubilation, that no one knew more about the tired jumento they had left by the door. They looked for them a lot among the bushes and fields; everything was useless, they didn't find it; nevertheless it is said that they found him dead tired near the north door of the Chapel and that he was buried there.

Since then, this image is venerated in what is now the Parish and Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe..
