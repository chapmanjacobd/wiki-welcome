History

Sargodha was established by the British as a canal-colony in 1903, and was initially spelt Sargoda. Sargodha was badly affected by an outbreak of the bubonic plague in 1903, and experienced a milder outbreak in 1904. Although it was a small town in the beginning, the British Royal Air Force built an airport here due to its strategic location. The term “Sargodha” has its origin in the words “Sar” meaning “pond” and “Godha” meaning “Sadhu”, which means “Pond of Godha”. This city was founded by Lady Trooper by the supervision of Sir Charles Montgomery Rivaz KCSI (1845 – 7 October 1926), a colonial administrator in British India and Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab from 1902–1907.

Traditional food and drink

The cuisine of Sargodha is similar to that of other regions of South Asia, with some of it originating from the royal kitchens of 16th-century Mughal emperors.

Garlic, ginger, turmeric, red chili, and garam masala are used in most dishes, and home cooking regularly includes curry.
