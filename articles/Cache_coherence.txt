An illustration showing multiple caches of some memory, which acts as a shared resource

Incoherent caches: The caches have different values of a single address location.

In computer architecture, cache coherence is the uniformity of shared resource data that ends up stored in multiple local caches. When clients in a system maintain caches of a common memory resource, problems may arise with incoherent data, which is particularly the case with CPUs in a multiprocessing system.
