Painting by Ã‰douard-Henri Avril: two men and a woman having a threesome.

Bisexual pornography is a genre of pornography that most typically depicts men and at least one woman who all perform sex acts on each other. A sex scene involving women and one man is generally not identified or labeled as bisexual, even if the female performers engage in sexual acts with each other.
