"This article is about signaling at the cellular level. For systemic signal transduction, see Transduction (physiology).

Simplified representation of major signal transduction pathways in mammals.

Signal transduction is the process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events, most commonly protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases, which ultimately results in a cellular response. Proteins responsible for detecting stimuli are
