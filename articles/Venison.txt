"For other uses, see Venison (disambiguation).

See also: deer hunting and game hunting

Venison originally meant the meat of a game animal but now refers primarily to the meat of elk or deer (or antelope in South Africa). Venison can be used to refer to any part of the animal, so long as it can be consumed, including the internal organs. Venison, much like beef or pork, is categorized into specific cuts, including roast, sirloin, and ribs.
