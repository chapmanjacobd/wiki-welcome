"Region of active deformation between colliding lithospheric plates

Simplified diagram of a convergent boundary

A convergent boundary is an area on Earth where two or more lithospheric plates collide. One plate eventually slides beneath the other causing a process known as subduction. The subduction zone can be defined by a plane where many earthquakes occur, called the Wadatiâ€“Benioff zone. These collisions happen on scales of millions to tens of millions of years and can lead to volcanism,
