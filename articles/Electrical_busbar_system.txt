Enclosure comparison with normal wiring & with busbar system

HRC Fuse switch disconnector and cylindrical fuse holders mounted on to a busbar

Electrical busbar systems (sometimes simply referred to as busbar systems) are a modular approach to electrical wiring, where instead of a standard cable wiring to every single electrical device, the electrical devices are mounted onto an adapter which is directly fitted to a current carrying busbar. This modular approach is used in distribution boards, automation panels and other kinds of installation in an electrical enclosure.

Busbar systems are subject to safety standards for design and installation along with electrical enclosure according to IEC 61439-1 and vary between countries and regions.

Content & types of busbar systems

Incoming cable attached to busbar via clamps without drilling the busbar

A busbar system usually contains couple of busbar holders, busbars, Adapters to mount devices, clamps either with protective covering or without covering to powerup or distribute the current from the busbar system & busbar mountable electrical devices.

Electrical busbar systems can be differentiated by the distance between center of each busbar and vary according to maximum current carrying capacity of the system which depends on IEC standards. commonly known busbar system types.

40 mm Busbar System (Current carrying capacity up to 300–400 Amps)

60 mm Busbar System (Current carrying capacity up to 800–2500 Amps)

100 mm Busbar System (Current carrying capacity up to 1250 Amps)

185 mm Busbar System (Current carrying capacity up to 2500 Amps)

Advantages and disadvantages over traditional electrical wiring

Advantage

Electrically Safe installation up to IP 60 inside the cabinet,

Drastically reduce space required inside the cabinet

Easy trouble shooting in case of switch gear failure

Pre-tested short circuit rating

Mounting of 2, 3, 4 or 5 pole switchgear in a single construction

Time saving during construction of the cabinet

Disadvantages

Commercially not viable if the number of switch gears is low

Specialists needed for construction of the busbar system from a wiring diagram

Lack of adapters for mounting different electrical devices on the busbar

Special type of busbars needed to construct busbar system which can carry current more than 800 Ampear
