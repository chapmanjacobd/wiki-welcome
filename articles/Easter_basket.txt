Croatian Easter basket

An Easter basket is a special basket used in Easter celebrations. Easter baskets are typically filled with Easter eggs, food, toys, or other gifts depending on one's culture. As many people give up sweets as their Lenten sacrifice, individuals receive them in their Easter baskets after having abstained from them during the preceding forty days of Lent.
