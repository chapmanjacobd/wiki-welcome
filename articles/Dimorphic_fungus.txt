Candida albicans growing as yeast cells and filamentous (hypha) cells

Dimorphic fungi are fungi that can exist in the form of both mold and yeast. This is usually brought about by change in temperature and the fungi are also described as thermally dimorphic fungi. An example is Talaromyces marneffei, a human pathogen that grows as a mold at room temperature, and as a yeast at human body temperature.

The term dimorphic is commonly used for fungi that can grow both as yeast and filamentous cells
