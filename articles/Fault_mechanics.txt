An element of rock under stress

Fault mechanics is a field of study that investigates the behavior of geologic faults.

Behind every good earthquake is some weak rock. Whether the rock remains weak becomes an important point in determining the potential for bigger earthquakes.

On a small scale, fractured rock behaves essentially the same throughout the world, in that the angle of friction is more or less uniform (see Fault fr
