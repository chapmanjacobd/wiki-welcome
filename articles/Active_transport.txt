Cellular mechanism

In cellular biology, active transport is the movement of molecules across a cell membrane from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentrationâ€”against the concentration gradient. Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: primary active transport that uses adenosine triphosphate (
