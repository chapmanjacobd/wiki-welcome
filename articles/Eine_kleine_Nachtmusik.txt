Posthumous portrait of Mozart (1819, Barbara Krafft)

Eine kleine Nachtmusik (Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major), K. 525, is a 1787 composition for a chamber ensemble by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The German title means "a little serenade", though it is often rendered more literally as "a little night music". The work is written for an ensemble of 2 violins, viola, and cello with optional double bass but is often performed by string orchestras.
