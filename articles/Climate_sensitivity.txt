Change in Earth's temperature caused by changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations

2 levels, there is an initial warming. This warming gets amplified by the net effect of feedbacks. Self-reinforcing feedbacks include the melting of sunlight-reflecting ice, and higher evaporation increasing average atmospheric water vapour (a greenhouse gas).

Climate sensitivity is a measure of how much the Earth's climate wil
