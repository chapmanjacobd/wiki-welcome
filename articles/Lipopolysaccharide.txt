Structure of a lipopolysaccharide

Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), also known as lipoglycans and endotoxins, are large molecules consisting of a lipid and a polysaccharide composed of O-antigen, outer core and inner core joined by a covalent bond; they are found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

The term lipooligosaccharide ("LOS") is used to refer to a low-molecular-weight form of bacterial lipo
