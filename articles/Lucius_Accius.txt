Lucius Accius (/ˈækiəs/; 170 – c. 86 BC), or Lucius Attius, was a Roman tragic poet and literary scholar. The son of a freedman and a freedwoman , Accius was born at Pisaurum in Umbria, in 170 BC. The year of his death is unknown, but he must have lived to a great age, since Cicero (born 106 BC, hence 64 years younger) writes of having conversed with him on literary matters.
