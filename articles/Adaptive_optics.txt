A deformable mirror can be used to correct wavefront errors in an astronomical telescope.

Illustration of a (simplified) adaptive optics system. The light first hits a tipâ€“tilt (TT) mirror and then a deformable mirror (DM) which corrects the wavefront. Part of the light is tapped off by a beamsplitter (BS) to the wavefront sensor and the control hardware which sends updated signals to the DM and TT mirrors.
