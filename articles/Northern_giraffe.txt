Giraffa camelopardalis in the Zoo d'Amn√©ville

The northern giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), also known as three-horned giraffe, is the type species of giraffe native to North Africa.

In the current IUCN taxonomic scheme, there is only one species of giraffe with the name G. camelopardalis and nine subspecies, but alternative taxonomic hypotheses have proposed two to eleven species.
